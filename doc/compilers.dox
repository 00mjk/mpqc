   To compile with GNU compilers:
   @code
   ./configure CXX=g++
   @endcode

   We are not aware of any significant issues with the GNU compilers.


   @section Intel

   To compile with Intel compilers, set appropriate CXX (and optionally C and FC):
   @code
   ./configure CXX=icpc
   @endcode
   
   C++11 support is incomplete as of version 13.
   See
   <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/c0x-features-supported-by-intel-c-compiler">
   C++11 Features Supported by IntelÂ® C++ Compiler
   </a>

   Compiling Eigen generates lots of warnings #2536 and #2196.  
   Those can be disabled with <tt>-wd</tt> switch, eg:
   @code
   ./configure CXX=icpc CXXFLAGS="-wd2536,2196"
   @endcode

   Using for range loops and openmp causes Intel compilers (at least version 13.0.1) to segfault,
   <tt>internal error: assertion failed at: "shared/cfe/edgcpfe/checkdir.c", line 5406<\tt>.
   As a workaround in production code use @link foreach @endlink macro.
