      /** A KeyVal constructor is used to generate a MolecularFragment
          object from the input. The full list of keywords
          that are accepted is below.

          <table border="1">

          <tr><td><b>%Keyword</b><td><b>Type</b><td><b>Default</b><td><b>Description</b>

          <tr><td><tt>molecule</tt><td>Molecule<td>none<td>the Molecule object that this molecule is part of (proto-molecule).

          <tr><td><tt>fragment</tt><td>integer<td>0<td>Specifies atoms of which fragment defined in the proto-molecule
          object will be considered for including into this molecule (see Molecule KeyVal documentation). By default,
          all atoms will be considered.

          <tr><td><tt>includes_atoms</tt><td>integer[] <td>none<td>(optional) only atoms connected by
          "normal" chemical bonds to the atoms specified by this keyword will be considered (atomic indices are 0-based).
          The normal chemical bonds are generated for the proto-molecule object using
          the same distance criterion as that used by IntCoorGen object
          to generate bonds (see IntCoorGen documentation).

          <tr><td><tt>excludes_atoms</tt><td>integer[] <td>none<td>(optional) only atoms NOT connected by
          "normal" chemical bonds to the atoms specified by this keyword will be considered. See documentation for <tt>includes_atoms</tt>.

        <tr><td><tt>symmetry</tt><td>string<td><tt>auto</tt><td>The
        Schoenflies symbol of the point group.  This is case insensitive.
        It should be a subgroup of D<sub>2h</sub>.  If it is <tt>auto</tt>,
        then the appropriate subgroup of D<sub>2h</sub> will be found.

        <tr><td><tt>symmetry_tolerance</tt><td>double<td>1.0e-4<td>When
        a molecule has symmetry, some atoms may be related by symmetry
        operations.  The distance between given atoms and atoms generated
        by symmetry operations is compared to this threshold to determine
        if they are the same.  If they are the same, then the coordinates
        are cleaned up to make them exactly symmetry equivalent.  If the
        given molecule was produced by a optimization that started in C1
        symmetry, but produced a roughly symmetric structure and you would
        like to begin using symmetry, then this may need to be increased a
        bit to properly symmetrize the molecule.

        <tr><td><tt>symmetry_frame</tt><td>double[3][3]<td>[[1 0 0][0 1
        0][0 0 1]]<td>The symmetry frame.  Ignored for <tt>symmetry =
        auto</tt>.

        <tr><td><tt>origin</tt><td>double[3]<td>[0 0 0]<td>The origin of
        the symmetry frame. Specified in the same units as used by proto-molecule.
        Ignored for <tt>symmetry = auto</tt>.

        <tr><td><tt>add_ghosts</tt><td>boolean<td>false<td>If true, the atoms
        in proto-molecule that are not of this fragment will be included as ghosts
        (zero-charge atoms that carry basis functions; see documentation for
        <tt>ghost</tt> keyword for Molecule).

          </table>
          Note that although MolecularFragment is derived from Molecule, its KeyVal constructor does not
          accept all Molecule keywords.
