The simple input format consists of keywords followed by a ":" followed by
a value.  The keywords are case sensitive.  The values might be modified by
options found in parenthesis.  For example, the following input performs an
optimization of water using density functional theory with the B3LYP
exchange-correlation functional:

<pre>
\% B3LYP optimization of water
optimize: yes
method: KS (xc = B3LYP)
basis: 3-21G*
molecule: (angstrom)
    O    0.172   0.000   0.000
    H    0.745   0.000   0.754
    H    0.745   0.000  -0.754
</pre>
<br>

Comments begin with a <tt>%</tt> and continue to the end of the line.
Keyword values, such as method names, method options, or
basis set names containing special characters, such as a space,
parentheses, or square braket, must be quoted inside a pair of double quotes:
<pre>
\% DZP CCSD(T)_R12 energy of H2
optimize: no
method: "CCSD(T)_R12" (f12="stg-3g[1.0]")
basis: "DZP (Dunning)"
auxbasis: cc-pV6Z (uc)
molecule:
    H    0.000   0.000   0.700
    H    0.000   0.000  -0.700
</pre>

   </dl>

   The following options are valid with the <tt>KS</tt>, <tt>RKS</tt>, and
   <tt>UKS</tt> methods:
   <dl>
     <dt><tt>grid</tt><dd> Specifies the grid to be used for numerical
        integrations.  The following values can be given:
        <dl>
           <dt><tt>xcoarse</tt><dd>

           <dt><tt>medium</tt><dd>
           <dt><tt>fine</tt><dd>
           <dt><tt>xfine</tt><dd>
           <dt><tt>ultrafine</tt><dd>
        </dl>
     <dt><tt>xc</tt><dd> Specifies the exchange-correlation functional.
        There is no default.  See the table in the StdDenFunctional
        class documentation for the possible values.
   </dl>

   The following options are valid with R12 methods:
   <dl>
     <dt><tt>f12</tt><dd> Specifies the correlation factor used to construct the geminals.
     The default value is <tt>stg-6g[1.3]</tt> (geminal exponent of 1.5 is a compromise value
     that seems to work well with most orbital basis sets; if the specialized R12-optimized basis sets of
     Peterson are used, the respecive recommended values will be used automatically).
     The following values can be given:
     <dl>
       <dt><tt>stg-Ng[Y]</tt><dd>Use a Slater-type geminal, \f$ \exp(- Y r_{12})\f$,
       where Y is the orbital exponent (typical values between 0.5 and 2.0),
       expanded in terms of N Gaussian-type geminals (N must be greater or equal to 1). The use
       of this correlation factor requires that the Libint2 library was used to configure
       and compile MPQC.
       <dt><tt>r12</tt><dd>Use the linear correlation factor, which was used in the original
       R12 theory. The linear factor is less effective than the Slater-type geminal and should only be
       used by experts. The use of this correlation factor requires that the Libint1 library
       was used to configure and compile MPQC.
       <dt><tt>none</tt><dd>R12-dependent terms will not be used. This is only useful for comparing
       with the standard methods or accessing certain features (e.g. DF-MP2) not available
       with the conventional implementations.
     </dl>
     
     <dt><tt>app</tt><dd> Specifies the R12 approximation. The default is <tt>app=C</tt> and should be fine for most non-expert uses.

       <dt><tt>A''</tt><dd> Use approximation A'' (unpublished method by Valeev).
       <dt><tt>B</tt><dd> Use approximation B.
       <dt><tt>C</tt><dd>Use approximation C. This is the default.

     <dl>
       <dt><tt>diag</tt><dd> Use the diagonal orbital-invariant ansatz with coefficients
       fixed by the first-order cusp-conditions (due to Ten-no). This is the default and recommended for
       most non-experts.
       <dt><tt>ijij</tt><dd> Same meaning as <tt>diag</tt>.
       <dt><tt>ijkl</tt><dd> Use the original orbital-invariant ansatz of Klopper.
       <dt><tt>ijpq</tt><dd> Use pq ansatz.
     </dl>

     <dt><tt>ri</tt><dd> Specifies the manner in which the resolution-of-the-identity is used.
     The default is <tt>ri=cabs+</tt> and should be used by all non-experts.
     The following values can be given:
     <dl>
       <dt><tt>abs</tt><dd>Use the Auxiliary Basis Set method of Klopper and Samson.
       <dt><tt>abs+</tt><dd>Same as <tt>abs</tt> but use the union of the orbital and the
                            given auxiliary basis as the actual auxiliary
                            basis set used. 
       <dt><tt>cabs</tt><dd>Use the Complementary Auxiliary Basis Set method of Valeev.
       <dt><tt>cabs+</tt><dd>Same as <tt>cabs</tt>
                            but use the union of the orbital and the
                            given auxiliary basis as the actual auxiliary
                            basis set used. This is the default.
