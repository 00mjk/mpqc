### Synopsis
The Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry (MPQC) platform is a research package for *ab initio* simulation of the electronic structure of molecules and periodic solids. The current (4th) version of the package, or __MPQC4__, is a modern reenvisioning of the conceptual design of the original MPQC platform using the massively-parallel tensor framework [TiledArray](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray), distributed task-based programming model and runtime [MADWorld](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness), and the Gaussian integrals library [Libint](https://github.com/evaleev/libint).

### Developers
MPQC4 is developed by the [Valeev Group](http://research.valeyev.net) at [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu).

### License

MPQC4 is freely available under the terms of the GPL v3+ licence. See the the included LICENSE file for details. If you are interested in using MPQC4 under different licensing terms, please contact us.
