## Prerequisites

The following are mandatory top-level prerequisites
- C++ compiler with support for the [C++14 standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/64029.html). This includes the following compilers:
  - [GNU C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/), version 5.0 or higher
  - [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), version 3.4 or higher
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/), version 3.1 and higher
- [TiledArray](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray), source from the master branch
- [Libint](http://libint.valeyev.net), version 2.4.0 or higher
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), version 3.0 or higher
- [Boost libraries](www.boost.org/)
- Intel Thread Building Blocks (TBB), available in a [commercial](software.intel.com/tbbâ€Ž) or
  an [open-source](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) form
- (for documentation only) Doxygen

The following are transitive dependencies of the above:
- [MADNESS parallel runtime](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness)
- BLAS and LAPACK libraries

## Compile TiledArray
Please refer to [TiledArry Wiki](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray/wiki)
for information on how to compile TiledArray.

## Compile Libint
- obtain the latest version of Libint library from [here](https://github.com/evaleev/libint/releases) (download the library marked "standard ints only")
- compile and install according to [Libint Wiki](https://github.com/evaleev/libint/wiki#compiling-libint-library).

## Compile MPQC

1. Configure cmake
2. Build
3. (optional) Validate
4. Install

### Configuring MPQC

Run cmake from a build directory in which MPQC will be built. For many reasons you should avoid building in the source directory.
There is a number of variables that you may need to provide to `cmake`, such as the C++ compiler to use, the MPI compiler wrapper to use, etc.
At a minimum, you will need to specify the installed locations of the top-level prerequisites, as shown in the example script:

```
#!/bin/bash

export MPQC_SOURCE=/path/to/mpqc/source/code/directory
export TiledArray_INSTALL = /path/to/tiledarray/install/directory
export LIBINT2_INSTALL = /path/to/libint/install/direcotry

cmake \
    -DTiledArray_INSTALL_DIR= ${TiledArray_INSTALL} \
    -DLIBINT2_INSTALL_DIR=${LIBINT2_INSTALL} \
    -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost/install/direcotry \
    ${MPQC_SOURCE}
```

In practice we recommend using one of the provided *toolchain* files that come with TiledArray to configure MPQC
using exactly the same compiler and library combination that was used to compile TiledArray.

The most useful MPQC-specific `cmake` variables are listed below:

|Variables            |Description|
|---------------------|-----------|
| `TiledArray_INSTALL_DIR` | path to TiledArray install directory |
| `LIBINT2_INSTALL_DIR` | path to Libint2 install directory |
| `BOOST_ROOT` | root path for Boost |
| `TA_POLICY` |  dense or sparse, default sparse. control which policy to use with TiledArray. Some classes may only support sparse |
| `MPQC_VALIDATION_TEST_PRINT` | default off, control if print output after validation test failed |

### Building MPQC
For simplicity here we assume that `cmake` was used to generate UNIX Makefiles (which is the default). To build, validate, and install
MPQC run the
following commands:
- `make`
- (optional) `make check`
- `make install`

## Platform-Specific Notes

### MacOS

#### System Integrity Protection (SIP)
Intel MKL and TBB libraries on MacOS come with user-configurable [RPATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath).
Due to the use of [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899)(SIP)
on recent MacOS platforms it is not sufficient to load the appropriate `mklvars`/`tbbvars` scripts in a shell
to allow MPQC find these libraries. Rather than disabling SIP, it is possible to run MPQC with SIP enabled
using a script that sets the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable before calling MPQC. Store this in an executable script, named `mpqcrun.sh`,
```
#!/bin/sh

source /opt/intel/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh intel64
source /opt/intel/tbb/bin/tbbvars.sh intel64
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/tiledarray/install/directory/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

$*
```
and execute MPQC as `mpqcrun.sh /path/to/mpqc/binary <input_file>`. To use this script when validating MPQC,
set environment variable `MPQC_PRE_CMD` to the full path to this script before executing `make check`.

#### Example: MPQC build script

[A simple shell script](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/mpqc4/blob/master/bin/osx-brew-build.sh) that uses HomeBrew to install basic prerequisites.
