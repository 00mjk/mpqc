To compile MPQC using cmake:

CMAKE 2.8.8 or above is required.
If no cmake is found in path, one will be downloaded and built in ./cmake
when first running ./configure.

Running
$ ./configure cmake 
will FORCE to build and use CMAKE in ./cmake

MPQC relies on several external package, built in ./external directory
* Eigen is already bundled in ./external/eigen.tar.gz
* Boost will be downloaded and built regardless of whenever one is installed,
  since Boost depends heavily on compiler.
* LAPACK and HDF5 will be downloaded and built only if none are found on the system.

First, try
$ ./configure
$ make

If it works - great!

If the build fails, try to disable new features which rely on C++11 features and external packages
./configure  -DMPQC_NEW_FEATURES=OFF


Several configure options are available:
$ ./configure -h

Most relevant options/variables are:

-D - passed directly to CMAKE command
--debug - forces debug build
--prefix - the installation directory
CXX - the C++ compiler

The MPQC can either be built in source or in a build directory, e.g.
$ mdkir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make
