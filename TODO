Figure out how to convert FullRank TileVariant to LowRank TileVariant

Optimize my all FullRank functions, try and be at least as fast as TileArray in
matrix expressions involving only full rank tiles.


========
= Tensor
========
- Add wrapper for BTAS. 


===========
= Integrals
===========
- Use BTAS::view to get integrals into parts of tensors.
