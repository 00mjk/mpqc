                                 Version 4

DESCRIPTION
===========

  The Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry (MPQC) platform is a research package
  for *ab initio* simulation of the electronic structure of molecules and periodic
  solids, with primary focus on many-body electronic structure methods, such as coupled-cluster.

  The current (4th) version of the package, sometimes referred to as <b>MPQC4</b>, is a modern
  reenvisioning of the conceptual design of the original MPQC platform using the massively-parallel tensor
  framework <a href="https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray">TiledArray</a>, distributed task-based programming model
  and runtime <a href="https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness">MADWorld</a>, and the Gaussian integrals library
  <a href="https://github.com/evaleev/libint">Libint</a>.

  MPQC runs on Unix shared-memory and distributed-memory parallel computers.
