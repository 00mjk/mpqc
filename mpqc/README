             The Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry Program
                                 MPQC 1.3

DESCRIPTION
===========

  MPQC computes the properties of molecules, ab initio, on a wide variety of
computer architectures.

  MPQC can compute closed shell and general restricted open shell
Hartree-Fock energies and gradients, density functional theory energies and
gradients, second order open shell perturbation theory (OPT2[2]) and
Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPT2) energies, and second order closed
shell Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory energies and gradients.  It also
includes an internal coordinate geometry optimizer.

  MPQC runs on Unix compatible workstations (Intel/Linux, SGI R8000, IBM
RS/6000), symmetric multi-processors (SGI Power Challenge), and massively
parallel computers (IBM SP, Intel Paragon).
