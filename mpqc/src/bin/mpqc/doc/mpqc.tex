\begin{abstract}
The Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry program (MPQC) computes
the properties of molecules, {\it ab initio}, on a wide variety
of computer architectures.

\begin{sloppypar}
MPQC can compute closed shell and general restricted open shell
Hartree-Fock energies and gradients, second order open shell
perturbation theory (OPT2[2]) and Z-averaged perturbation theory
(ZAPT2) energies, and second order closed shell M\o{}ller-Plesset
perturbation theory energies and gradients.  It also includes a
robust internal coordinate geometry optimizer that efficiently
optimizes molecules with many degrees of freedom.
\end{sloppypar}

MPQC runs on Unix compatible workstations (Intel/Linux, SGI R8000,
IBM RS/6000), symmetric multi-processors (SGI Power Challenge), and
massively parallel computers (IBM SP2, Intel Paragon).

\chapter{Introduction}
The Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry program (MPQC) computes
the properties of molecules, {\it ab initio}, on a wide variety
of computer architectures.

MPQC can compute closed shell and general restricted open shell
Hartree-Fock energies and gradients, second order open shell
perturbation theory (OPT2[2]) and Z-averaged perturbation theory
(ZAPT2) energies, and second order closed shell M\o{}ller-Plesset
perturbation theory energies and gradients.  It also includes a
robust internal coordinate geometry optimizer that efficiently
optimizes molecules with many degrees of freedom.

MPQC runs on Unix compatible workstations (Intel/Linux, SGI R8000,
IBM RS/6000), symmetric multi-processors (SGI Power Challenge),
and massively parallel computers (IBM SP2, Intel Paragon).

MPQC is designed using object-orient programming techniques and
implemented in the C++ programming language.  This design has
propagated even to the input of MPQC which is object-oriented
as well.  The user specifies a group of objects that the program
creates when it starts.  MPQC manipulates the objects to produce
energies, gradients, geometries, and properties.

The object-oriented nature of the input makes this user manual
read like a bit like a programmers manual.  Object-orient oriented
terminology is thus a natural way to describe the input and a
short \htmlref{glossary}{glossary} is provided in the back for
those in need.

\chapter*{Glossary}
\label{glossary}

\begin{itemize}
\item[{\bfseries abstract class}]
          An abstract class cannot be created.  It is used
          as a parent class of another class.
\index{abstract}
\item[{\bfseries concrete class}]
          A class that is fully described and can be created.
\index{concrete}
\item[{\bfseries class}]
          A class data type.  Data with class types are objects.
\index{class}
\item[{\bfseries derivation}]
          The process of making a new class based on an already
          existing class.  The only way to use an abstract class
          is to make a derivative concrete class.
\index{derivation}
\item[{\bfseries instantiation}]
          The process of creating an object of a given class.
\index{instantiation}
\item[{\bfseries object}]
          A piece of data with associated functions.  The data
          contained and manipulations that can be done on an object
          are described in a class.
