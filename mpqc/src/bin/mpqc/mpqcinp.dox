   MPQC supports two input formats.  The primary input is
an object oriented format which gives users access to all
of MPQC's options.  The second format allows access to a
subset of MPQC's capabilities, but is more intuitive and
easier to learn.  New users are advised to start with the
simplified format.  MPQC can be used to convert the simplified
format to the full object-oriented format.
