README file for OPT++, an experimental optimization package in C++.


This is an experimental package of algorithms for nonlinear equations
and optimization written in C++. This package uses R.B. Davies's matrix
package newmat7.

The motivation for this package is to build an environment for the
rapid prototyping and development of new algorithms in optimization.

Warning: This is still fairly experimental. 


Notes: Changes to newmat7

print.C 	printing routines taken from tmt.cxx
newmat6.C 	added output statements for out of bounds message.
newmat.h 	added two new member function Dot and Norm2 to
		ColumnVector
