% Abstract goes here 
The advent of object-oriented programming has generated new concepts
in software development. There are many advantages to using
object-oriented programming techniques including, re-usability of
code, faster prototyping of new algorithms. This report outlines a
proposed C++ class library for nonlinear optimization.
