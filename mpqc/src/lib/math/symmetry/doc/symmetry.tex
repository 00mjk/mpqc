\index{symmetry}

The symmetry library implements a few basic ideas in group theory.  Namely
it provides a character table for a given point group.  Currently it does
not support the cubic point groups (e.g. $T_d$ or $I_h$).  The only classes
intended for public consumption are the \clsnmref{CharacterTable} and
\clsnmref{PointGroup} classes.  \clsnmref{PointGroup} stores the
Schoenflies symbol for a point group, and can generate a
\clsnmref{CharacterTable} on the fly.  A \clsnmref{CharacterTable} contains
\clsnmref{IrreducibleRepresentation}'s and \clsnmref{SymmetryOperation}'s.

The following include files are provided by the symmetry library:

\begin{description}
\item[\filnm{pointgroup.h}]
This is the only include file for the symmetry library.  It provides
definitions for all of the symmetry-related classes.
