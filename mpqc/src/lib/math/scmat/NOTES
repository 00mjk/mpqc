Covariant type conformance is used in member functions.  This is
indicated with the "current" type which is the type of the
overriding class.

The 

SCMatrix
  // concrete:
  CTOR()

  // abstract:
  int nrow()
  int ncol()
  double& element(int,int)
  current clone()
  current rowcol_clone(current) // and related functions
  void multiply(current, current)
  void transpose()
  void set(double)
  void set(current)

  // notable missing functions
  int resize(int,int) // resize isn't possible for all matrix types
  
LocalSCMatrix: SCMatrix
  // concrete:
  CTOR(int,int)
  implementations of all of SCMatrix's abstract functions
  
DistributedSCMatrix: SCMatrix
  // concrete:
  CTOR(DistributionMap,DistributionMap)
  implementations of all of SCMatrix's abstract functions
