\section{The \clsnm{GaussianBasisSet} Class}
\label{GaussianBasisSet}\index{GaussianBasisSet}

The \clsnm{GaussianBasisSet} class is used describe a
basis set atomic composed of atomic gaussian orbitals.

\begin{description}
  \item[\keywd{molecule}] The gives a \clsnmref{Molecule} object.
     The is no default.

  \item[\keywd{puream}] If this boolean parameter is true then
     5D, 7F, etc. will be used.  Otherwise all cartesian functions
     will be used.  The default depends on the particular basis set.

  \item[\keywd{name}] This is a string giving the name of the basis set.
     Table~\ref{basissets} gives some of the recognized basis set names.
     It may be necessary to put the name in double quotes. There is no
     default.

  \item[\keywd{basis}] This is a vector of basis set names that can give a
     different basis set to each atom in the molecule.  If the
     \keywd{element} vector is given, then it gives different basis sets
     to different elements.  The default is to give every atom the
     basis set specified in \keywd{name}.

  \item[\keywd{element}] This is a vector of elements.  If it is given
     then it must have the same number of entries as the \keywd{basis}
     vector.

  \item[\keywd{basisdir}] A string giving a directory where basis
     set data files are to be sought.  See the text below for a
     complete description of what directors are consulted.

  \item[\keywd{basisfiles}] Each keyword in this vector of files is
     appended to the directory specified with \keywd{basisdir} and basis
     set data is read from them.

  \item[\keywd{matrixkit}] Specifies a \clsnmref{SCMatrixKit} object.
     It is usually not necessary to give this keyword, as the default
     action should get the correct \clsnmref{SCMatrixKit}.

\end{description}

Several files directories are checked for basis set data.  First, basis
sets can be given by the user in the \keywd{basis} section at the top level
of the main input file.  Next, if a path is given with the \keywd{basisdir}
keyword, then all of the files given with the \keywd{basisfiles} keyword
are read in after appending their names to the value of \keywd{basisdir}.
Basis sets can be given in these files in the \keywd{basis} section at the
top level as well.  If the named basis set still cannot be found, then
\clsnm{GaussianBasisSet} will try convert the basis set name to a file name
and check first in the directory given by \keywd{basisdir}.  Next it checks
for the environment variable \verb|SCLIBDIR|.  If it is set it will look
for the basis file in \filnm{\$SCLIBDIR/basis}.  Otherwise it will look in
the source code distribution in the directory \filnm{SC/lib/basis}.  If the
executable has changed machines or the source code has be moved, then it
may be necessary to copy the library files to your machine and set the
\verb|SCLIBDIR| environmental variable.

\section{The \clsnm{Integral} Class}
\label{Integral}\index{Integral}

The \clsnm{Integral} abstract class acts as a factory to provide
objects that compute one and two electron integrals.
