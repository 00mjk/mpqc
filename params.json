It also\r\nincludes an internal coordinate geometry optimizer.\r\n\r\n  MPQC runs on Unix compatible workstations, symmetric multi-processors,\r\nand parallel computers.\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n=======\r\n\r\n  This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License or the\r\nGNU Library General Public License, as documented in each file.
